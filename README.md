# Rholang Spec (0.1)

_This is a work-in-progress transcription from a [Aug 3 google doc draft][3Aug]_.

Rholang is a behaviorally typed, concurrent programming language, with
a focus on message-passing and formally modeled by the ρ-calculus, a
reflective, higher-order extension of the π-calculus. It is designed
to be used to implement protocols and "smart contracts" on a
general-purpose blockchain, but could be used in other settings as
well.
